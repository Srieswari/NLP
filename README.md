This repository contains code for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that leverages TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and various machine learning classifiers to classify text data. The project aims to categorize text documents into different classes(household items) or categories based on the content.


Overview


NLP text classification is used in various domains, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more. This project uses the following key components:

- TF-IDF Vectorization: A technique to transform text data into numerical vectors, emphasizing the importance of terms within documents and across a corpus.

- Machine Learning Classifiers: Various supervised machine learning algorithms are employed for text classification, including but not limited to:
  - KNN
  - Random Forest
